                            <span>Social justice refers to the fair and equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and privileges within a society. It involves addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, and oppression. Social justice advocates for the rights of marginalized groups and aims to create a society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and benefits. This can be achieved through policies and programs that promote equity, fairness, and inclusion. Social justice also involves challenging systems and structures that perpetuate inequality and discrimination.</span>
